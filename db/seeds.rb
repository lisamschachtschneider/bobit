# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
# If you run it again it will create the same objects again in the database
# Examples:
#Song.create(artist: 'Kanye West', title: 'The Kim or something song')
